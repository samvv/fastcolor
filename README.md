# Fast Color Library

This is a color conversion library that has been optimised for speed and
accuracy. In a similar fashion to [gl-matrix][glm], this library consists
entirely out of pure functions that can easily be optimised away by VMs and web
bundlers.

 - **Full support for tree shaking.** Distribute only what you need!
 - **Growing collection of mostly pure functions.** Easily compose functions
   for more complex behavior.
 - **MIT licensed**, so you basically can do what you want with it (though a
   backlink is always appreciated).
